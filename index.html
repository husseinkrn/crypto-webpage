   <b> A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto</b> is a collection of binary data which is designed to work as a medium of exchange. Individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger, which is a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership.Cryptocurrencies are generally fiat currencies, as they are not backed by or convertible into a commodity
    Cryptocurrency does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority. Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed to a central bank digital currency (CBDC)

  Bitcoin was the first decentralized cryptocurrency introduced in 2009. Bitcoin uses the blockchain technology and has outperformed gold
   generating a 155% annualized gain over gold’s 6% annualized loss over the last 5 years. Its price in July 2010 at 0.06/coin USD is now worth
    over 4000.00/coin USD today, making it one of the biggest investment phenomenon in modern history. Since 2009 blockchain technology has gained
     momentum. Not only because of the tremendous spike in Bitcoin’s worth, but also through an increased awareness of its importance and greater trust among the investors
</p>
<p>Recently, major banking institutions and technology companies such as Intel, Barclays or Walmart have invested their time and money into the promise of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
   This has led to countries with weakening currencies to adopt digital currency to take the place of traditional notes that have depreciated. Some of these early adopter countries include Brazil, Colombia,
    Turkey and Venezuela.

</p>
  <p>
    Wealthy countries are also exploring adopting cryptocurrency as legal tender. According to a report by Bloomberg, the central banks of Japan, European Union and Holland are currently conducting research projects and trials on digital currencies.

<h1>Why To Choose Crypto ?</h1>

   <b>Fraud-proof:</b>  When cryptocurrency is created, all confirmed transactions are stored in a public ledger. All identities of coin owners are encrypted to ensure the legitimacy of record keeping. Because the currency is decentralized, you own it. Neither government nor bank has any control over it.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b> Identity Theft:</b> The ledger ensures that all transactions between “digital wallets” can calculate an accurate balance. All transactions are checked to make sure that the coins used are owned by the current spender. This public ledger is also referred to as a “transaction blockchain”. Blockachain technology ensures secure digital transactions through encryption and “smart contracts” that make the entity virtually unhackable and void of fraud. With security like this, blockchain  technology is poised to impact nearly every segment of our lives.


  </li>
  <li>
   <b> Instant Settlement:</b> Blockchain is the reason why cryptocurrency has any value. Ease of use is the reason why cryptocurrency is in high demand. All you need is a smart device, an internet connection and instantly you become your own bank making payments and money transfers.

  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Accessible:</b>  There are over two billion people with access to the Internet who don't have rights to use to traditional exchange systems. These individuals are clued-in for the cryptocurrency market.

  </li>
  <li>
  <b> You are the owner:</b> There is no other electronic cash system in which your account is owned by you.
